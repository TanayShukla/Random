# Random

This is a collection of Random source codes, unorganized. For EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY  Many projects are duplicates or revisions of each other. Many of them have outdated depedencies. My goal is to collectively put them together so that they are compilable and help people interested in malware research analyze them and learn from these samples.
# Note

NOT MY CODE! I am not the author. This repository is for study purposes only, do not message me about your lame hacking attempts.
